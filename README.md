## Description  

Purpose of this application that generates a random password based on user-selected criteria. This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by your JavaScript code.
Password Length will be between 8 and 128 characters including special, numeric, lower and uppercase. The application will validate user input and ensure that at least one character type is selected. The user will also have the option to click a button to copy the password to their clipboard. The application is also responsive, ensuring that it adapts to multiple screen sizes.

I struggled with getting the functions to run. You can see additional specific comments in the javascript itself. 

## Credits

I'd like to thank my instructor Omar, and Peter, the TA, who will be grading this assignment.
